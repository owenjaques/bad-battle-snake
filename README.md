# bad-battle-snake
After having too many difficulties with the python starter snake given I have taken the endeavor to create my own.

To train the snakes first run 'engine server' in the folder with the game server found at https://github.com/battlesnakeio/engine. Then run a seperate instance of each snake for each snake you wish to train, then ensure those snakes are in the snake-config.json file under "snakes". I've also been adding 'dumb' snakes to simulate other snakes doing different things. Then simply run the trainer.py file. (You may need to change the path in the trainer.py to the game engine).
